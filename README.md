# Word-Guess-Game

Homework # 3 for The Coding Bootcamp at the University of Minnesota

A "Ready Player One" based hangman game.
This game was created as my first introduction to Javascript.

I combined my knowledge of HTML, CSS, a little bit of Bootstrap and basic vanilla Javascript to create this keyboard based hangman game.
